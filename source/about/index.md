Background
----------

I am a graduate from McMaster University's Software Engineering program. As part of my undergrad I have worked at various companies to augment my learning.

* Rayment & Collins
* BlackBerry
* IBM

My work there consisted primarily of Full-Stack development using Java, Python, PHP, JavaScript and other Web 2.0 languages. Technologies used were mainly MySQL, MongoDB and Redis.

For a year in 2016, I worked on my own solo-startup called LiveGrip. I developed an Android application and designed the backend architecture and built the app to ~100 daily active users at its peak before shutting it down in 2017.

I am currently exploring pathways in Data Science and Data Engineering. I frequently partake in Kaggle Competitions and work on various Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Computer Vision projects to bolster my learning. 

My hopes are that I can use my experience and education in Software Engineering and combine it with Data Science to build Machine Learning products.
